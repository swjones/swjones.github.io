All the information you need to know:

For reference or even learning, the Markdown Cheat Sheet:

It is often a good idea to be able to preview what your Markdown document will
look like when it is rendered. Here are some standalone desktop Markdown
renderering software recommendations:

For Mac, I suggest using Mou:

For Linux, I suggest reText:

## Git/GitHub

If you are new to Git or GitHub, you might find
[this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/svn-to-git-prepping-your-team-migration)
short page by Atlassian useful. It explains the basic commands at the heart of
using Git in a concise table.

In fact, Atlassian hosts a wonderful description of how to "Get Started" with
Git, that is useful both for people migrating from `svn` or starting from
scratch. You can check it out
