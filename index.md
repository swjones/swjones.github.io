I am a musician, physicist and astrophysicist originally from Walsall, a town
in the Black Country region of the UK. Currently I live in Santa
Fe, New Mexico (USA) working as a staff scientist in the [X
Computational Physics (XCP)
Division](https://www.lanl.gov/org/padwp/adx/computational-physics/index.php)
at [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](http://www.lanl.gov/).

##My Journey (so far)

Prior to my position as a staff scientist in XCP-2 at LANL I was a [Director's
Fellow](http://www.lanl.gov/careers/career-options/postdoctoral-research/postdoc-program/postdoc-appointment-types.php)
in the [Computational Physics and Methods
(CCS-2)](http://www.lanl.gov/org/padste/adtsc/computer-computational-statistical-sciences/computational-physics-methods/index.php)
here at the lab. Before that I was an [Alexander von
Humboldt](http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html) Fellow at
[HITS](www.h-its.org), prior to which I was a post-doctoral research fellow in
[Dr. Falk Herwig](www.astro.uvic.ca/~fherwig)'s [Computational Stellar
Astrophysics (CSA)](http://csa.phys.uvic.ca) research group at the University
of Victoria in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.  I did my Ph.D. in physics
at [Keele University](http://www.keele.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Dr.
Raphael Hirschi](http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/~hirschi).
