# Markdown

All the information you need to know about Markdown:  
[http://whatismarkdown.com/](http://whatismarkdown.com/)

For reference or even learning, the [Markdown
Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
is an excellent resource.

It is often a good idea to be able to preview what your Markdown document will
look like when it is rendered. Here are some standalone desktop Markdown
renderering software recommendations:

* For Mac, I suggest using Mou:

* For Linux, I suggest ReText:
