# Building acoustic absorption panels at home

I recently built some 2'x4' (24"x48") acoustic panels for my home studio
following the idea of Matthew Perks's [DIY
Perks](https://youtu.be/pABvTWSxOes). Here is a photograph of the panels when
they were complete, and another of them handing in my makeshift home studio in
Santa Fe, NM:

## Materials and tools

Here is a quick rundown of the materials and tools that I used to make the
panels.

### Materials (per 2'x4' (24"x48") panel)
* 2 x (24" x 1" x 3/4") timber
* 2 x (48" x 1" x 3/4") timber
* 8 x 3/2" screws
* 6 bath towels (approximately 2' x 4', with at least one larger than 2' x 4')
* fabric of choice (again, larger than 2' x 4') for covering the front of the
  panel

### Tools
* power screwdriver with philips head, countersinking bit and 1/8" drill bit
* wood glue
* scissors
* tough upholstering needle and thread
* sandpaper
