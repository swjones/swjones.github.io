My research focuses on the evolution and explosion of stars and the origin
of the elements; a large part of which involves performing computer
simulations.  I am also a part of the [NuGrid
collaboration](www.nugridstars.org): an international group of scientists
working on problems related to stellar evolution, supernovae and
nucleosynthesis.

You can find/read my scientific publications by any of the following means.

My ORCID is: [0000-0003-3970-1843](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3970-1843)  

You can find my publication list [here in classic
ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?library&libname=Samuel+Jones+Bibliography&libid=56f53bf0b4)
or [here in
ADSbeta](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#/public-libraries/K2at6KkbRSGMdRjfi6wOhg).

Pictured below are two images from my research. They are [volume
renderings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering) of data from 3D
hydrodynamic simulations of a sub-sonic combustion front in a very dense
oxygen-neon [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) (left) and
turbulent convection in the shell of a massive star about 10 days before it
explodes as a core-collapse
[supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova). The flame (left) is
burning oxygen and neon into mostly iron ashes (pictured here in red). The
convective shell (right) burns oxygen into mostly silicon and sulfur. The
convection is driven by the release of nuclear binding energy from oxygen
fusion reactions.

You can read more about me and my work in [this

my publications and talks are available via the links at the top of the page.
