I've been playing and making music for a long time. Here are some of my current
projects.

Solo jazz noodlings

Some performances, generally of standards, are [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ZWIGMG6HZFz-5yePfdZ2A).

Illuminations

Currently my most active project. Writing, recording and performing original
music with elements of funk, jazz, soul and blues with Juan Aniceto, Bryan
Bakevich, Joe Hecker and Kevin Sennott.
I will have a link to recordings as soon as some are available.

Interlaken

My longest-running project with Tom Duncan. It's a mix of alternative and
electronic music. It is available [here on Bandcamp](https://interlakenmusic.bandcamp.com/).
