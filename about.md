I am an astrophysicist and a post-doctoral research fellow of the [Alexander
von Humboldt Foundation](http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html) in
[Prof. Dr. Fritz RÃ¶pke](http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~fritz/)'s [Physics
of Stellar Objects (PSO)](http://www.h-its.org/en/research/pso/) research
group at the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies
(HITS)](www.h-its.org).  My research focuses on the evolution and explosion of
stars and the origin of the elements; a large part of which involves
performing computer simulations.  I am also a Co-PI of the [NuGrid
collaboration](www.nugridstars.org): an international group of scientists
working on problems related to stellar evolution, supernovae and
nucleosynthesis.

Prior to my position as an
[AvH](http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html) fellow at
[HITS](www.h-its.org), I was a post-doctoral research fellow in [Dr. Falk
Herwig](www.astro.uvic.ca/~fherwig)'s [Computational Stellar Astrophysics
(CSA)](http://csa.phys.uvic.ca) research group at the University of Victoria
in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.
I did my Ph.D. in physics at [Keele University](http://www.keele.ac.uk/) under
the supervision of [Dr. Raphael
Hirschi](http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/~hirschi).

# Research

Pictured below are two images from my research. They are [volume
renderings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering) of data from 3D
hydrodynamic simulations of a sub-sonic combustion front in a very dense
oxygen-neon [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) (left) and
turbulent convection in the shell of a massive star about 10 days before it
explodes as a core-collapse
[supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova). The flame (left) is
burning oxygen and neon into mostly iron ashes (pictured here in red). The
convective shell (right) burns oxygen into mostly silicon and sulfur. The
convection is driven by the release of nuclear binding energy from oxygen
fusion reactions.

You can read more about me and my work in [this
article](http://www.h-its.org/news/simulating-the-death-of-stars/). A list of
my publications and talks are available via the links at the top of the page.

# Music

I write music as part of a collective of musicians based in London, UK called
[Interlaken](http://www.artistecard.com/interlaken). It is a project that is
constantly evolving. From time to time new demos or recorded tracks appear on
the [Interlaken SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/interlaken_music). Feel
free to take a listen and let me know what you think!
