I am an astrophysicist at the [University of Victoria](http://www.uvic.ca/)
in British Columbia, Canada, researching the evolution and explosion of
stars and the origin of the elements. At UVic, I am part of
[Falk Herwig](http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~fherwig)'s [Computational
Stellar Astrophysics](http://csa.phys.uvic.ca/) group.

I was recently awarded a [Humboldt post-doctoral research
fellowship](http://www.humboldt-foundation.de).
Hence, I will soon be leaving beautiful British Columbia for
beautiful Heidelberg, Germany.

In Heidelberg, I will join [Fritz RÃ¶pke](http://www.friedrich-roepke.de/)'s
group at the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical
Studies](http://www.h-its.org/english/research/tap/) (HITS).

I did my Ph.D. in physics at [Keele University](http://www.keele.ac.uk/)
under the supervision of
[Dr. Raphael Hirschi](http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/~hirschi).

A large part of my work involves performing computer simulations.

I am an active member of the [NuGrid
collaboration](www.nugridstars.org)---an international group
of scientists working on problems related to stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis.

I am also interested in hydrodynamic processes operating in stellar
interiors, including convection and the coupling of hydrodynamics and
combustion.
