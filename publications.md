Abstract:  
This work investigates the properties of convection in stars with particular emphasis on entrainment across the upper convective boundary (CB). Idealised simulations of turbulent convection in the O-burning shell of a massive star are performed in $4\pi$ geometry on $768^3$ and $1536^3$ grids, driven by a representative heating rate. A heating series is also performed on the $768^3$ grid. The $1536^3$ simulation exhibits an entrainment rate at the upper CB of $1.33\times10^{-6}~M_\odot~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The $768^3$ simulation with the same heating rate agrees within 17 per cent. The entrainment rate at the upper convective boundary is found to scale linearly with the driving luminosity and with the cube of the shear velocity at the upper boundary, while the radial RMS fluid velocity scales with the cube root of the driving luminosity, as expected. The mixing is analysed in a 1D diffusion framework, resulting in a simple model for CB mixing. The analysis confirms previous findings that limiting the MLT mixing length to the distance to the CB in 1D simulations better represents the spherically-averaged radial velocity profiles from the 3D simulations and provides an improved determination of the reference diffusion coefficient $D_0$ for the exponential diffusion CB mixing model in 1D. From the 3D simulation data we adopt as the convective boundary the location of the maximum gradient in the horizontal velocity component which has $2\sigma$ spatial fluctuations of $\approx0.17 H_P$ . The exponentially decaying diffusion CB mixing model with $f = 0.03$ reproduces the spherically-averaged 3D abundance profiles.

Abstract:  
Based on stellar evolution simulations, we demonstrate that rapidly accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems are an astrophysical site for the intermediate neutron-capture process. During recurrent and very strong He-shell flashes in the stable H-burning accretion regime H-rich material enters the He-shell flash convection zone. {}<SUP>12</SUP>{{C}}(p,γ ){}<SUP>13</SUP>{{N}} reactions release enough energy to potentially impact convection, and i process is activated through the {}<SUP>13</SUP>{{C}}{(α ,{{n}})}<SUP>16</SUP>{{O}} reaction. The H-ingestion flash may not cause a split of the convection zone as it was seen in simulations of He-shell flashes in post-AGB and low-Z asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We estimate that for the production of first-peak heavy elements this site can be of similar importance for galactic chemical evolution as the s-process production by low-mass AGB stars. The He-shell flashes result in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection of the accreted and then i-process enriched material, via super-Eddington-luminosity winds or Roche-lobe overflow. The WD models do not retain any significant amount of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of ≲ 10 % depending on mass and convective boundary mixing assumptions. This makes the evolutionary path of such systems to supernova Ia explosion highly unlikely.

**Uncertainty in Explosive Yields of Core-Collapse Supernovae**  
Andrews, Sydney, Fryer, Chris, Even, Wesley P., **Jones, Samuel**, Pignatari, Marco, NuGrid Collaboration  
American Astronomical Society Meeting Abstracts  
2017AAS...22934121A  
  
Abstract:  
The chemical composition of the ejecta from the violent explosions of massive stars has been vital for probing the nature of the explosions and their effect on galactic chemical evolution and universal chemical composition. The sensitivity of numerical explosive nucleosynthetic yields in core-collapse supernovae to several key parameters is examined in one dimension. This uncertainty study is applied to 15, 20, and 25 solar mass stars with different energy prescriptions for shock revival. The effects of the resolution of the temperature and density profiles run through the NuGrid nuclear network are explored, as well as the differences between large and small isotope networks for the initial conditions of the explosion calculations.

**The impact of (n,$\gamma$) cross section uncertainties of unstable isotopes near N=50 on nucleosynthesis models of the i process in He-shell flash white dwarfs**

Abstract:  
The first peak s-process elements Rb, Sr, Y and Zr in the post-AGB star Sakurai's object (V4334 Sagittarii) are the result of i-process nucleosynthesis in a post-AGB very-late thermal pulse event. The remaining discrepancies between the observed and predicted elemental abundance distributions may be due to uncertain nuclear physics data used in the simulations. We identify the unstable isotopes of Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y and Zr whose (n,$\gamma$) cross section uncertainties will affect simulation predictions. We show that simple, but fast, one-zone simulations can be used instead of more realistic multi-zone stellar simulations for extensive nuclear sensitivity and uncertainty studies, provided that the one-zone setup is first calibrated using the multi-zone simulations. We find that among the 52 unstable isotopes selected for our analysis only uncertainties in the (n,$\gamma$) cross sections of $^{85}$Br, $^{88}$Kr and $^{89}$Kr have significant effects on the predicted abundances of Rb, Sr, Y and Zr. A further analysis, that used multi-zone simulations, has shown that the uncertainty in the (n,$\gamma$) cross section of $^{89}$Rb may also be important in this case. Our findings apply more generally to any i-process site with similar neutron exposure, such as possibly rapidly accreting white dwarfs.

Abstract:  
We provide a set of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations that applies established physics assumptions simultaneously to low- and intermediate-mass and massive star models. Our goal is to provide an internally consistent and comprehensive nuclear production and yield database for applications in areas such as presolar grain studies. Our non-rotating models assume convective boundary mixing (CBM) where it has been adopted before. We include 8 (12) initial masses for Z=0.01 (0.02). Models are followed either until the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase or the end of Si burning, complemented by simple analytic core-collapse supernova (SN) models with two options for fallback and shock velocities. The explosions show which pre-SN yields will most strongly be effected by the explosive nucleosynthesis. We discuss how these two explosion parameters impact the light elements and the s and p process. For low- and intermediate-mass models, our stellar yields from H to Bi include the effect of CBM at the He-intershell boundaries and the stellar evolution feedback of the mixing process that produces the <SUP>13</SUP>C pocket. All post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations use the same nuclear reaction rate network and nuclear physics input. We provide a discussion of the nuclear production across the entire mass range organized by element group. The entirety of our stellar nucleosynthesis profile and time evolution output are available electronically, and tools to explore the data on the NuGrid VOspace hosted by the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre are introduced.(12 data files).

Abstract:  
The reaction rate of <SUP>12</SUP>C(α,γ<SUP>)16</SUP>O is critical in modeling the evolution of stars throughout the many stages of their lifecycles. Yet despite its importance, a precise determination of the cross section remains elusive. This is largely because the cross section at stellar energies is over an off-resonance region, where it is determined by the delicate interference between several broad resonances. Complicating the situation, are the high energy tails of subthreshold levels whose properties are difficult to determine directly. These resonances can interfere in a complicated way that is often difficult to determine. In this presentation the different interference solutions for the E1 ground state, 6.05 MeV, and 6.13 MeV transitions will be discussed by way of a phenomenological R-matrix analysis, addressing several questions raised in the literature. It will be shown how the data of are in good agreement with both the asymptotic normalization coefficients determined by and the data of, if systematic uncertainties are taken into consideration.Research supported by NSF Phys-0758100, and JINA Phys-0822648.

Abstract:  
Galactic chemical evolution is a topic that involves nuclear physics, stellar evolution, galaxy evolution, observation, and cosmology. Continuous communication and feedback between these fields is a key component in improving our understanding of how galaxies form and how elements are created and recycled in galaxies and intergalactic space. In this proceedings, we present the current state of the JINA-NuGrid chemical evolution pipeline. It is designed to probe the impact of nuclear astrophysics uncertainties on galactic chemical evolution, to improve our knowledges regarding the origin of the elements in a cosmological context, and to create the required interdisciplinary connections.

**Do electron-capture supernovae make neutron stars?. First multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the oxygen deflagration**

Abstract:  
Context. In the classical picture, electron-capture supernovae and the accretion-induced collapse of oxygen-neon white dwarfs undergo an oxygen deflagration phase before gravitational collapse produces a neutron star. These types of core collapse events are postulated to explain several astronomical phenomena. In this work, the oxygen deflagration phase is simulated for the first time using multidimensional hydrodynamics. <BR /> Aims: By simulating the oxygen deflagration with multidimensional hydrodynamics and a level-set-based flame approach, new insights can be gained into the explosive deaths of 8-10 M<SUB>☉</SUB> stars and oxygen-neon white dwarfs that accrete material from a binary companion star. The main aim is to determine whether these events are thermonuclear or core-collapse supernova explosions, and hence whether neutron stars are formed by such phenomena. <BR /> Methods: The oxygen deflagration is simulated in oxygen-neon cores with three different central ignition densities. The intermediate density case is perhaps the most realistic, being based on recent nuclear physics calculations and 1D stellar models. The 3D hydrodynamic simulations presented in this work begin from a centrally confined flame structure using a level-set-based flame approach and are performed in 256<SUP>3</SUP> and 512<SUP>3</SUP> numerical resolutions. <BR /> Results: In the simulations with intermediate and low ignition density, the cores do not appear to collapse into neutron stars. Instead, almost a solar mass of material becomes unbound from the cores, leaving bound remnants. These simulations represent the case in which semiconvective mixing during the electron-capture phase preceding the deflagration is inefficient. The masses of the bound remnants double when Coulomb corrections are included in the equation of state, however they still do not exceed the effective Chandrasekhar mass and, hence, would not collapse into neutron stars. The simulations with the highest ignition density (log <SUB>10</SUB>ρ<SUB>c</SUB> = 10.3), representing the case where semiconvective mixing is very efficient, show clear signs that the core will collapse into a neutron star.

**Uncertainties in Galactic Chemical Evolution Models**  
Côté, Benoit, Ritter, Christian, O'Shea, Brian W., Herwig, Falk, Pignatari, Marco, **Jones, Samuel**, Fryer, Chris L.  
The Astrophysical Journal  
2016ApJ...824...82C  
  
Abstract:  
We use a simple one-zone galactic chemical evolution model to quantify the uncertainties generated by the input parameters in numerical predictions for a galaxy with properties similar to those of the Milky Way. We compiled several studies from the literature to gather the current constraints for our simulations regarding the typical value and uncertainty of the following seven basic parameters: the lower and upper mass limits of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), the slope of the high-mass end of the stellar IMF, the slope of the delay-time distribution function of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the number of SNe Ia per M <SUB>☉</SUB> formed, the total stellar mass formed, and the final mass of gas. We derived a probability distribution function to express the range of likely values for every parameter, which were then included in a Monte Carlo code to run several hundred simulations with randomly selected input parameters. This approach enables us to analyze the predicted chemical evolution of 16 elements in a statistical manner by identifying the most probable solutions, along with their 68% and 95% confidence levels. Our results show that the overall uncertainties are shaped by several input parameters that individually contribute at different metallicities, and thus at different galactic ages. The level of uncertainty then depends on the metallicity and is different from one element to another. Among the seven input parameters considered in this work, the slope of the IMF and the number of SNe Ia are currently the two main sources of uncertainty. The thicknesses of the uncertainty bands bounded by the 68% and 95% confidence levels are generally within 0.3 and 0.6 dex, respectively. When looking at the evolution of individual elements as a function of galactic age instead of metallicity, those same thicknesses range from 0.1 to 0.6 dex for the 68% confidence levels and from 0.3 to 1.0 dex for the 95% confidence levels. The uncertainty in our chemical evolution model does not include uncertainties relating to stellar yields, star formation and merger histories, and modeling assumptions.

**H ingestion into He-burning convection zones in super-AGB stellar models as a potential site for intermediate neutron-density nucleosynthesis**  
**Jones, S.**, Ritter, C., Herwig, F., Fryer, C., Pignatari, M., Bertolli, M. G., Paxton, B.  
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society  
2016MNRAS.455.3848J  
  
Abstract:  
We investigate the evolution of super-AGB (SAGB) thermal pulse (TP) stars for a range of metallicities (Z) and explore the effect of convective boundary mixing (CBM). With decreasing metallicity and evolution along the TP phase, the He-shell flash and the third dredge-up (TDU) occur closer together in time. After some time (depending upon the CBM parametrization), efficient TDU begins while the pulse-driven convection zone (PDCZ) is still present, causing a convective exchange of material between the PDCZ and the convective envelope. This results in the ingestion of protons into the convective He-burning pulse. Even small amounts of CBM encourage the interaction of the convection zones leading to transport of protons from the convective envelope into the He layer. H-burning luminosities exceed 10<SUP>9</SUP> (in some cases 10<SUP>10</SUP>) L<SUB>☉</SUB>. We also calculate models of dredge-out in the most massive SAGB stars and show that the dredge-out phenomenon is another likely site of convective-reactive H-<SUP>12</SUP>C combustion. We discuss the substantial uncertainties of stellar evolution models under these conditions. Nevertheless, the simulations suggest that in the convective-reactive H-combustion regime of H ingestion the star may encounter conditions for the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process). We speculate that some CEMP-s/r stars could originate in i-process conditions in the H ingestion phases of low-Z SAGB stars. This scenario would however suggest a very low electron-capture supernova rate from SAGB stars. We also simulate potential outbursts triggered by such H ingestion events, present their light curves and briefly discuss their transient properties.

ArXiv e-prints  
2015arXiv150505500D  
  
Abstract:  
We investigate whether the anomalous elemental abundance patterns in some of the C-enhanced metal-poor-s+r (CEMP-r/s) stars are consistent with predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from the i-process, a neutron-capture regime at neutron densities intermediate between those typical for the slow (s) and rapid (r) processes. Conditions necessary for the i-process are expected to be met at multiple stellar sites, such as the He-core and He-shell flashes in low-metallicity low-mass stars, super-AGB and post-AGB stars, as well as low-metallicity massive stars. We have found that single-exposure one-zone simulations of the i-process reproduce the abundance patterns in some of the CEMP-r/s stars much better than the model that assumes a superposition of yields from s- and r-process sources. Our previous study of nuclear data uncertainties relevant to the i-process revealed that they could have a significant impact on the i-process yields obtained in our idealized one-zone calculations, leading, for example, to ~0.7dex uncertainty in our predicted [Ba/La] ratio. Recent 3D hydrodynamic simulations of convection driven by a He-shell flash in post-AGB Sakurai's object have discovered a new mode of non-radial instabilities: the Global Oscillation of Shell H-ingestion. This has demonstrated that spherically symmetric stellar evolution simulations cannot be used to accurately model physical conditions for the i-process.

**Hybrid C-O-Ne white dwarfs as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae: dependence on Urca process and mixing assumptions**  
Denissenkov, P. A., Truran, J. W., Herwig, F., **Jones, S.**, Paxton, B., Nomoto, K., Suzuki, T., Toki, H.  
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society  
2015MNRAS.447.2696D  
  
Abstract:  
When carbon is ignited off-centre in a CO core of a super-asymptotic giant branch star, its burning in a convective shell tends to propagate to the centre. Whether the C flame will actually be able to reach the centre depends on the efficiency of extra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary mixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the centre. As a result, a C-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a `hybrid' WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1D stellar evolution computations, the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich material, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material from its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would be processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then be transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes associated with high abundances of <SUP>23</SUP>Na and <SUP>25</SUP>Mg. They are followed by off-centre C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entire star. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data for their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized uncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative instances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of explosive C ignition, either off or in the centre. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor models have much lower C-to-O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C ignition than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed diversity of the SNe Ia.

**Code dependencies of pre-supernova evolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars: evolution to the end of core helium burning**  
**Jones, S.**, Hirschi, R., Pignatari, M., Heger, A., Georgy, C., Nishimura, N., Fryer, C., Herwig, F.  
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society  
2015MNRAS.447.3115J  
  
Abstract:  
Massive stars are key sources of radiative, kinetic and chemical feedback in the Universe. Grids of massive star models computed by different groups each using their own codes, input physics choices and numerical approximations, however, lead to inconsistent results for the same stars. We use three of these 1D codes - GENEC, KEPLER and MESA - to compute non-rotating stellar models of 15, 20 and 25 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and compare their nucleosynthesis. We follow the evolution from the main sequence until the end of core helium burning. The GENEC and KEPLER models hold physics assumptions used in large grids of published models. The MESA code was set up to use convective core overshooting such that the CO core masses are consistent with those obtained by GENEC. For all models, full nucleosynthesis is computed using the NuGrid post-processing tool MPPNP. We find that the surface abundances predicted by the models are in reasonable agreement. In the helium core, the standard deviation of the elemental overproduction factors for Fe to Mo is less than 30 per cent - smaller than the impact of the present nuclear physics uncertainties. For our three initial masses, the three stellar evolution codes yield consistent results. Differences in key properties of the models, e.g. helium and CO core masses and the time spent as a red supergiant, are traced back to the treatment of convection and, to a lesser extent, mass loss. The mixing processes in stars remain the key uncertainty in stellar modelling. Better constrained prescriptions are thus necessary to improve the predictive power of stellar evolution models.

**The Final Fate of Stars that Ignite Neon and Oxygen Off-center: Electron Capture or Iron Core-collapse Supernova?**  
**Jones, Samuel**, Hirschi, Raphael, Nomoto, Ken'ichi  
The Astrophysical Journal  
2014ApJ...797...83J  
  
Abstract:  
In the ONeMg cores of 8.8-9.5 M <SUB>☉</SUB> stars, neon and oxygen burning is ignited off-center. Whether or not the neon-oxygen flame propagates to the center is critical for determining whether these stars undergo Fe core collapse or electron-capture-induced ONeMg core collapse. We present more details of stars that ignite neon and oxygen burning off-center. The neon flame is established in a manner similar to the carbon flame of super-AGB stars, albeit with a narrower flame width. The criteria for establishing a flame can be met if the strict Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability is adopted. Mixing across the interface of the convective shell disrupts the conditions for the propagation of the burning front, and instead the shell burns as a series of inward-moving flashes. While this may not directly affect whether or not the burning will reach the center (as in super-AGB stars), the core is allowed to contract between each shell flash. Reduction of the electron fraction in the shell reduces the Chandrasekhar mass and the center reaches the threshold density for the URCA process to activate and steer the remaining evolution of the core. This highlights the importance of a more accurate treatment of mixing in the stellar interior for yet another important question in stellar astrophysics—determining the properties of stellar evolution and supernova progenitors at the boundary between electron capture supernova and iron core-collapse supernova.

**Uncertainties in Astrophysical β-decay Rates from the FRDM**  
Bertolli, M. G., Möller, P., **Jones, S.**  
Nuclear Data Sheets  
2014NDS...120..188B  
  
Abstract:  
β<SUP>-</SUP>-decay rates are of crucial importance in stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, as they are a key component in stellar processes. Tabulated values of the decay rates as functions of both temperature T and density ρ are necessary input to stellar evolution codes such as MESA, or largescale nucleosynthesis simulations such as those performed by the NuGrid collaboration. Therefore, it is interesting to know the uncertainties in these rates and the effects of these uncertainties on stellar structure and isotopic yields. We have calculated β-strength functions and reaction rates for nuclei ranging from <SUP>16</SUP>O to <SUP>339</SUP>136, extending from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line based on a quasi-particle random-phase approximation (QRPA) in a deformed folded-Yukawa single-particle model. Q values are determined from the finite-range droplet mass model (FRDM). We have investigated the effect of model uncertainty on astrophysical β<SUP>-</SUP>-decay rates calculated by the FRDM. The sources of uncertainty considered are Q values and deformation. The rates and their uncertainties are generated for a variety of temperature and density ranges, corresponding to key stellar processes. We demonstrate the effects of these rate uncertainties on isotopic abundances using the NuGrid network calculations.

Abstract:  
We present a new set of electron (e-) capture and β-decay rates that improves previous calculations by Takahara et al. and Oda et al. by: (a) incorporation of recent charge-exchange and β-decay data, (b) contributions of forbidden transitions, and (c) inclusion of e- screening corrections. The experimental nuclear input is supplemented by theoretical data based on large-scale shell model calculations in the full sd-shell space using the USDB interaction. The impact of these new rates on the late-stage stellar evolution of 8.8M<SUB>☉</SUB> star is demonstrated.

Abstract:  
The stellar mass range 8 〈~ M/M <SUB>☉</SUB> 〈~ 12 corresponds to the most massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and the most numerous massive stars. It is host to a variety of supernova (SN) progenitors and is therefore very important for galactic chemical evolution and stellar population studies. In this paper, we study the transition from super-AGB (SAGB) star to massive star and find that a propagating neon-oxygen-burning shell is common to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN) progenitors and the lowest mass iron-core-collapse supernova (FeCCSN) progenitors. Of the models that ignite neon-burning off-center, the 9.5 M <SUB>☉</SUB> star would evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the center, as in previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8 M <SUB>☉</SUB> model, however, fails to reach the center as the URCA process and an extended (0.6 M <SUB>☉</SUB>) region of low Y <SUB>e</SUB> (0.48) in the outer part of the core begin to dominate the late evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to follow the most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an evolutionary path to EC-SN in addition to that from SAGB stars undergoing thermal pulses (TPs). We also present models of an 8.75 M <SUB>☉</SUB> SAGB star through its entire TP phase until electron captures on <SUP>20</SUP>Ne begin at its center and of a 12 M <SUB>☉</SUB> star up to the iron core collapse. We discuss key uncertainties and how the different pathways to collapse affect the pre-SN structure. Finally, we compare our results to the observed neutron star mass distribution.

Abstract:  
We calculate β-transition rates for URCA nuclear pairs using the sd-shell-model framework of Wildenthal [B. H. Widenthal, Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys.PPNPDB0146-641010.1016/0146-6410(84)90011-5 11, 5 (1984)] with the modified Hamiltonian. We consider many β transitions including excited states necessary for electron capture and β decay with high Fermi energy of electrons at high electron density ρY<SUB>e</SUB> and temperature T relevant for the massive star and super-asymptotic-giant-branch star evolution. We provide β-transition rates for URCA nuclear pairs (A=23, 25, and 27) in the range of density 8.0 〈log<SUB>10</SUB>ρY<SUB>e</SUB>〈 9.2 in steps of 0.02 (Y<SUB>e</SUB> is the electron mole number and ρ is the nucleon density in units of g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and temperature 8.0 〈log<SUB>10</SUB>T〈 9.2 in steps of 0.05 (T is the temperature in units of K). This fine mesh is able to provide clearly the URCA density at log<SUB>10</SUB>ρY<SUB>e</SUB>=8.92 for A=23 and at log<SUB>10</SUB>ρY<SUB>e</SUB>=8.81 for A=25, while the URCA density is not clear for A=27. For the evolution of 8-10M<SUB>☉</SUB> stars, the use of the fine mesh is found to increase the cooling effect and affects the final fate of these stars.

Massive Stars: From alpha to Omega  
2013msao.confE.121J  
  
Abstract:  
I will present new stellar models in the transition mass range from super-AGB star to massive star (8≲ M/M_☉ ≲12). This mass range corresponds to the most massive AGB stars and the most numerous massive stars. It is host to a variety of supernova progenitors and is therefore very important for galactic chemical evolution and stellar population studies. Our models suggest that a propagating neon-oxygen burning shell is common to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN) progenitors and the lowest mass iron-core collapse supernova (FeCCSN) progenitors. Of our models that ignite neon burning off-center, a 9.5 Mo model will evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the center, as in previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8 Mo model, however, fails to reach the center as the URCA process and an extended (  0.6 Mo) region of low Ye ( 0.48) in the outer part of the core begin to dominate the late evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to follow the most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an evolutionary path to EC-SN in addition to that from S-AGB stars undergoing thermal pulses. I will also present the results of an 8.75 Mo super-AGB model for which we have calculated the entire thermal pulse phase until electron captures on ^{20}Ne begin at its centre. I will discuss the uncertainties affecting our understanding of stars in this transition mass range and present our latest results in an attempt to address some of these uncertainties.

Death of Massive Stars: Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts  
2012IAUS..279..341J  
  
Abstract:  
We investigate the lowest mass stars that produce Type-II supernovae, motivated by recent results showing that a large fraction of type-II supernova progenitors for which there are direct detections display unexpectedly low luminosity (for a review see e.g. Smartt 2009). There are three potential evolutionary channels leading to this fate. Alongside the standard `massive star' Fe-core collapse scenario we investigate the likelihood of electron capture supernovae (EC-SNe) from super-AGB (S-AGB) stars in their thermal pulse phase, from failed massive stars for which neon burning and other advanced burning stages fail to prevent the star from contracting to the critical densities required to initiate rapid electron-capture reactions and thus the star's collapse. We find it indeed possible that both of these relatively exotic evolutionary channels may be realised but it is currently unclear for what proportion of stars. Ultimately, the supernova light curves, explosion energies, remnant properties (see e.g. Knigge et al. 2011) and ejecta composition are the quantities desired to establish the role that these stars at the lower edge of the massive star mass range play.
